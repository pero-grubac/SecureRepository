    <h1>üîí Secure Document Repository</h1>
    <p>
        This application serves as a secure repository for storing documents, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity. It uses OpenSSL version 3.1.0 to provide robust encryption and security features.
    </p>
   <h2>‚ú® Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> Encrypts all stored documents to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenSSL Integration:</strong> Utilizes OpenSSL 3.1.0 for encryption and decryption operations.</li>
        <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Supports user authentication for controlled access to the repository.</li>
        <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Upload, download, and delete documents securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintains logs of all operations for tracking and security audits.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>üéõÔ∏è How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Launch the application and log in using your credentials.</li>
